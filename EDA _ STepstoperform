📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing data to understand its main characteristics, identify patterns, detect anomalies and prepare data for modeling.

Why is EDA Important?

EDA helps to:

Understand dataset structure, features and data types
Identify patterns and relationships between variables
Detect missing values, errors and outliers
Select important features for modeling
Choose suitable models and preprocessing techniques
Improve model accuracy and reliability

Types of Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Univariate Analysis

Analyzes one variable at a time.

Techniques:
Histograms → data distribution
Box plots → outlier detection
Bar charts → categorical data
Summary statistics → mean, median, mode, variance, std deviation

Purpose:

Understand distribution, spread and outliers

2. Bivariate Analysis

Analyzes two variables together to understand relationships.

Techniques:

Scatter plots → relationship between continuous variables
Correlation (Pearson) → strength of linear relationship
Covariance → direction of joint variation
Cross-tabulation → relationship between categorical variables
Line graphs → trends over time

Purpose:

Identify correlation, dependency or association

3. Multivariate Analysis

Analyzes more than two variables simultaneously.

Techniques:

Pair plots → multiple variable relationships
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) → dimensionality reduction
Spatial analysis → geographic data visualization
Time series analysis → trends, seasonality, autocorrelation

Purpose:

Understand complex interactions between variables

##Steps for Performing Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 1: Understand the Problem & Data

Define business or research objective
Identify variables and their meaning
Understand data types (numerical, categorical)
Note domain constraints and assumptions

Step 2: Import & Inspect Data

Load dataset safely
Check rows and columns
Identify missing values
Verify data types
Detect errors and inconsistencies

Step 3: Handle Missing Data

Identify missing data type (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
Decide to remove or impute

Use methods like:

Mean/Median imputation
Regression
KNN or ML-based imputation
Evaluate impact on results

Step 4: Explore Data Characteristics

Calculate summary statistics
Analyze distribution and spread
Check skewness and kurtosis
Detect anomalies and irregular patterns

Step 5: Data Transformation

Scaling (Min-Max, Standardization)
Encoding categorical variables
Log / square root transformations
Feature engineering
Aggregation or grouping

Step 6: Visualize Data Relationships

Categorical → bar charts, pie charts
Numerical → histograms, box plots, density plots
Relationships → scatter plots, heatmaps, correlations

Step 7: Handle Outliers

Detect using:

IQR
Z-score
Domain rules

Treat by:

Removing
Capping
Transforming
Decide based on context

Step 8: Communicate Insights

Summarize objectives and findings
Use clear visuals
Highlight patterns and anomalies
Mention limitations
Suggest next steps

🧠 Key Takeaway

EDA is a critical foundation step that improves data quality, guides feature selection and ensures better modeling decisions.
