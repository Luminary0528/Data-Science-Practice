# Data-Science-Practice
# Student Marks Analysis – Data Science Practice Project

This repository contains my beginner-level Data Science practice using Python, NumPy, and Pandas.  
It is part of my learning journey through the FreeCodeCamp 17-hour Data Science course.


## 📌 Project Summary

In this notebook, I’ve worked with a basic dataset (student marks) to practice data handling and analysis.  
I focused on:

- Importing data with Pandas
- Performing basic operations and calculations
- Understanding DataFrames and NumPy arrays
- Cleaning and exploring small datasets

This is an early-stage project, but it reflects my interest and commitment to building strong foundations in data science.


## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook


## 📁 Files

- 'datascience1.ipynb': Code notebook with exercises and data analysis using NumPy and Pandas.


## 🚀 What's Next

## 📓 Notebook Summaries
